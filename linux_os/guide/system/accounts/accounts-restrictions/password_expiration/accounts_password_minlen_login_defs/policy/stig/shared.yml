    {{{ full_name }}} passwords for new users must have a minimum of 15 characters.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to enforce a minimum 15-character password length for new user accounts.

    Add or modify the following line in the "/etc/login.defs" file:

    PASS_MIN_LEN 15

checktext: |-
    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} enforces a minimum 15-character password length for new user accounts by running the following command:

    $ sudo grep -i  pass_min_len /etc/login.defs

    PASS_MIN_LEN 15

    If the command does not return a "PASS_MIN_LEN" value of "15" or greater, does not return a line, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
