    {{{ full_name }}} must protect against or limit the effects of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by ensuring rate-limiting measures on impacted network interfaces are implemented.

fixtext: |-
    Configure "nftables" to be the default "firewallbackend" for "firewalld" by adding or editing the following line in "etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf":

    FirewallBackend=nftables

    Establish rate-limiting rules based on organization-defined types of DoS attacks on impacted network interfaces.

checktext: |-
    Verify "nftables" is configured to allow rate limits on any connection to the system with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -i firewallbackend /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf

    # FirewallBackend
    FirewallBackend=nftables

    If the "nftables" is not set as the "FirewallBackend" default, this is a finding.
